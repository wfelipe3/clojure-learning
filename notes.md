1. The difference between list and vector is that list is a linkedlist with better performance for getting removing or adding elements to the head, and vector is like an arraylist with random access
2. Do is used to do more than one thing, it is commonly used to execute side effects
3. def defines a value that can be used in the context, is like a variable, but it is not modifiable like a val in scala
4. fn defines an anonymous function 
5. defn is an abreviation to define a function with a name like (def hello (fn [] "hello")) -> (defn [] "hello")
6. The difference between array-map and hash-map is that array-map preserves order and hash-map is a hashed set of elements
